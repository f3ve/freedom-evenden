      'Avybe is a subscription-based video streaming service. As the first Engineer on this project I set up the boiler plate for the website, mobile app, and API. Eventually more engineers were hired on and my role evolved into a lead engineer. I led daily standup meetings and performed code review for the project. In addition to helping other engineers with their tasks I also did an extensive amount of work on the mobile app in React Native. The project was built using NextJS and Django.',
